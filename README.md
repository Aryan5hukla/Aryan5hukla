# Hi there, I'm Aryan Shukla 👋

I'm a B.Tech CS/IT student and an aspiring software engineer passionate about AI , Web Development and Cybersecurity. I love building, breaking, and debugging to understand how things work.  

Currently, I'm enhancing my web development and automation skills, diving into React.js and backend technologies like Node.js and Express. I'm open to collaborating on open-source projects and innovative automation tools while seeking guidance on backend best practices and AI integrations. Feel free to reach out to discuss frontend development, automation, or anything tech-related! 🚀
